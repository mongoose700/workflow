# Building a Workflow

## Introduction

A simple workflow looks something like this:

```swift
struct DemoWorkflow: Workflow {

    var name: String

    init(name: String) {
        self.name = name
    }

}

extension DemoWorkflow {

    struct State {}

    func makeInitialState() -> State {
        return State()
    }

    func workflowDidChange(from previousWorkflow: DemoWorkflow, state: inout State) {

    }

    func render(state: State, context: RenderContext<DemoWorkflow>) -> String {
        return "Hello, \(name)"
    }

}
```

A type conforming to `Workflow` represents a single node in the workflow tree. It should contain any
values that must be provided by its parent (who is generally responsible for creating child
workflows).

Configuration parameters, strings, network services… If your workflow needs access to a value or
object that it cannot create itself, they should be passed into the workflow's initializer.

Every workflow defines its own `State` type to contain any data that should persist through
subsequent render passes.

## Render

Workflows are only useful when they render a value for use by their parent (or, if they are the root
workflow, for display). This type is very commonly a view model, or `Screen`. The
`render(state:context:)` method has a couple of parameters, so we’ll work through them one by one.

```swift
func render(state: State, context: RenderContext<DemoWorkflow>) -> Rendering
```

### `state`

Contains a value of type `State` to provide access to the current state. Any time the state of
workflow changes, `render` is called again to take into account the change in state.

### `context`

The render context:

- provides a way for a workflow to defer to nested (child) workflows to generate some or all of its
  rendered output. We’ll walk through that process later on when we cover composition.
- allows a workflow to request the execution of asynchronous tasks (`Worker`s)
- generates event handlers for use in constructing view models.

In order for us to see the anything in our app, we'll need to return a `Screen` that can be turned
into a view controller:

```swift
    func render(state: State, context: RenderContext<DemoWorkflow>) -> DemoScreen {
        return DemoScreen(title: "A nice title")
    }
```

## Actions, or “Things that advance a workflow”

So far we have only covered workflows that perform simple tasks like generate strings or simple
screens with no actions. If our workflows take on a complicated roles like generating view models,
however, they will inevitably be required to handle events of some kind – some from UI events such
as button taps, others from infrastructure events such as network responses.

In conventional UIKit code, it is common to deal with each of those event types differently. The
common pattern is to implement a method like `handleButtonTap(sender:)`. Workflows are more strict
about events, however. Workflows require that all events be expressed as "Workflow Actions."

These actions should be thought of as the entry point to your workflow. If any action of any kind
happens (that your workflow cares about), it should be modeled as an action.

```swift
struct DemoWorkflow: Workflow {
    /// ...
}

enum Action: WorkflowAction {

    typealias WorkflowType = DemoWorkflow

    case refreshButtonTapped /// UI event
    case refreshRequestFinished(RefreshResponse) /// Network event

    func apply(toState state: inout DemoWorkflow.State) -> DemoWorkflow.Output? {
        /// ...
    }
}
```

## The Update Cycle

Every time a new action is received, it is applied to the current state of the workflow. If your
workflow does more than simply render values, the action's `apply` is the method where the logic lives.

There are two things that the `apply(toState:)` method is responsible for:

- Transitioning state
- (Optionally) emitting an output event

Note that the `render(state:context:)` method is called after every state change, so you can be sure
that any state changes will be reflected.

Since we have a way of expressing an event from our UI, we can now use the callback on our view
model to send that event back to the workflow:

```swift
func render(state: State, context: RenderContext<DemoWorkflow>) -> DemoScreen {
    // Create a sink of our Action type so we can send actions back to the workflow.
    let sink = context.makeSink(of: Action.self)

    return DemoScreen(
        title: "A nice title",
        onTap: { sink.send(Action.refreshButtonTapped) }
    )
}
```

## State

Some workflows do not need state at all – they simply render values based on the values they were
initialized with. But for more complicated workflows, state management is critical. For example, a
multi-screen flow only functions if we are able to define all of the possible steps (model the
state), remember which one we are currently on (persist state), and move to other steps in the
future (transition state).

To define your workflow's state, simply implement the associatedtype `State` via an enum or struct.

```swift
struct WelcomeFlowWorkflow: Workflow {

    enum State {
        case splashScreen
        case loginFlow
        case signupFlow
    }

    enum Action: WorkflowAction {
        case back
        /// ...
    }

    /// ...
}
```

!!! note
    Workflows (and their `State`) should always be implemented through value types (structs and
    enums) due to the way the framework handles state changes. This means that you can never capture
    references to `self`, but the consistent flow of data pays dividends – try this architecture for
    a while and we are confident that you will see the benefits.

## Workers, or "Asynchronous work the workflow needs done"

A workflow may need to do some amount of asynchronous work (such as a network request, reading from
a sqlite database, etc). Workers provide a declarative interface to units of asynchronous work.

To do something asynchronously, we define a worker that has an Output type and defines a `run`
method that that returns a Reactive Swift `SignalProducer`. When this worker will be run, the
`SignalProducer` is subscribed to starting the async task.

```swift
struct RefreshWorker: Worker {

    enum Output {
        case success(String)
        case error(Error)
    }

    func run() -> SignalProducer<RefreshWorker.Output, Never> {
        return SignalProducer(value: .success("We did it!"))
            .delay(1.0, on: QueueScheduler.main)
    }

    func isEquivalent(to otherWorker: RefreshWorker) -> Bool {
        return true
    }
}
```

Because a Worker is a declarative representation of work, it also needs to define an `isEquivalent`
to guarantee that we are not running more than one at the same time. For the simple example above,
it is always considered equivalent as we want only one of this type of worker running at a time.

In order to start asynchronous work, the workflow requests it in the render method, looking
something like:

```swift
    public func render(state: State, context: RenderContext<DemoWorkflow>) -> DemoScreen {

        context.awaitResult(for: RefreshWorker()) { output -> Action in
            switch output {
            case .success(let result):
                return Action.refreshComplete(result)
            case .error(let error):
                return Action.refreshError(error)

            }
        }
    }
```

When the context is told to await a result from a worker, the context will do the following:

- Check if there is already a worker running of the same type:
  - If there is not, or `isEquivalent` is false, call `run` on the worker and subscribe to the
    `SignalProducer`
  - If there is already a worker running and isEquivalent is true, continue to wait for it to
    produce an output.
- When the SignalProducer from the Worker returns an output, it is mapped to an Action and handled
  the same way as any other action.

## Output Events

The last role of the update cycle is to emit output events. As workflows form a hierarchy, it is
common for children to send events up the tree. This may happen when a child workflow finishes or
cancels, for example.

Workflows can define an output type, which may then be returned by Actions.

## Composition

Composition is the primary tool that we can use to manage complexity in a growing application.
Workflows should always be kept small enough to be understandable – less than 150 lines is a good
target. By composing together multiple workflows, complex problems can be broken down into
individual pieces that can be quickly understood by other developers (including future you).

The context provided to the `render(state:context:)` method defines the API through which
composition is made possible.

### The Render Context

The useful role of children is ultimately to provide rendered values (typically screen models) via
their `render(state:context:)` implementation. To obtain that value from a child workflow, the
`rendered(with context:key:)` method is invoked on the child workflow.

When a workflow is rendered with the context, the context will do the following:

- Check if the child workflow is new or existing:
  - If a workflow with the same type was used during the last render pass, the existing child
    workflow will be updated with the new workflow.
  - Otherwise, a new child workflow node will be initialized.
- The child workflow's `render(state:context:)` method is called.
- The rendered value is returned.

In practice, this looks something like this:

```swift
struct ParentWorkflow: Workflow {

    func render(state: State, context: RenderContext<ParentWorkflow>) -> String {
        let childWorkflow = ChildWorkflow(text: "Hello, World")
        return childWorkflow.rendered(with: context)
    }

}

struct ChildWorkflow: Workflow {

    var text: String

    // ...

    func render(state: State, context: RenderContext<ChildWorkflow>) -> String {
        return String(text.reversed())
    }
}
```
